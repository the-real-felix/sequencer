# Sequencer

A webcomic template, built with [reveal.js].

## Installation

### Development

Clone this repository and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-real-felix/sequencer
cd sequencer
npm install
```

### Production

Upload the contents of the `public` directory to your web server or point your document root to it.

## Usage

The `public/index.html` file contains a `<script src="dist/comic.js">` tag, which means we need to create `public/dist/comic.js`. The `rollup.config.js` file tells Rollup how to create this bundle, starting with `src/main.js` and including all its dependencies, including [reveal.js].

- `npm run build` â€” Builds the application to `public/dist/comic.js`, along with a sourcemap file for debugging.
- `npm start` â€” Launches a server, using [serve]. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:5000).
- `npm run watch` Will continually rebuild the application as your source files change.
- `npm run dev` Will run `npm start` and `npm run watch` in parallel.
